# Prerequisites

The following servers must be prepared exactly like in the `Technical Installation Manual` document.

The `smile` delivery account must exist.

The `<main_www_folder>/<project_name>` folder must exist, and must be owned by the `smile` user.

A full archive package must have been generated by the production team.

A new unique release name must have been generate. Example: `<project_name>_<release_version>`.

The main front server (for cron jobs and maintenance actions) will be called `frontMain`. It corresponds to:

- myFront1

All the other front servers will be called `frontOthers`. It corresponds to:

- myFront2
- myFront3
- ...

You can separate proxy servers (varnish + nginx). No source files will be delivered on these servers. In this case they correspond to:

- myProxy1
- myProxy2
- ...

Only the `smile` user must be used during the procedure.

# Extract The Package

<warning> All the following actions must be made on `frontMain` and `frontOthers`.

## Prepare the Folder

Create the main release folder if it does not exist yet:

```
mkdir -p <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases
```

Verify that the `<main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>` folder does not exist yet.

<error> If it already exist, the procedure must be stopped!

Create the new release folder:

```
mkdir -p <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>
```

Extract the archive package to the new release folder `<main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>`.

## Initialize the Rights

The rights must be initialized as followed:

```
chown -R smile.root <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>
chmod -R 644 <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>
chmod -R +X <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>

chmod +x <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>/bin/magento

chown -R smile.<php_fpm_group> <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>/app/etc
chown -R smile.<php_fpm_group> <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>/pub/static
chown -R smile.<php_fpm_group> <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>/var

chmod -R g+w <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>/app/etc
chmod -R g+w <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>/pub/static
chmod -R g+w <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>/var
```

# Prepare the Shared Folders and Files

<warning> This part must be executed only during the first deploy.

<warning> All the following actions must be made on `frontMain` and `frontOthers`.

## Create Shared Folders and Files

Create the main shared folder.

```
mkdir -p <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared
```

Create the shared folders and files.

```
mkdir -p <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/var/log
mkdir -p <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/var/report
mkdir -p <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/var/importexport
mkdir -p <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/var/import_history
mkdir -p <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/pub/media
mkdir -p <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/pub/static/_cache
mkdir -p <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/app/etc
touch <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/app/etc/config.php
touch <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/app/etc/env.php
```

## Initialize the Contents

The shared file `<main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/app/etc/env.php` must be initialized with the following lines:

```
!INCLUDE "magento/env.php"
```

The shared file `<main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/app/etc/config.php` must be initialized with the following lines:

```
!INCLUDE "magento/config.php"
```

The media shared folder must be initialized with the files of the first release.

```
cp -r \
<main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>/pub/media \
<main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/pub/
```

## Initialize the Rights

The rights must be initialized as followed:

```
chown smile.<php_fpm_group> <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/var/log
chown smile.<php_fpm_group> <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/var/report
chown smile.<php_fpm_group> <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/var/importexport
chown smile.<php_fpm_group> <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/var/import_history
chown smile.<php_fpm_group> <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/app/etc/config.php
chown smile.<php_fpm_group> <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/app/etc/env.php

chmod 775 <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/var/log
chmod 775 <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/var/report
chmod 775 <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/var/importexport
chmod 775 <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/var/import_history
chmod 664 <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/app/etc/config.php
chmod 664 <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/app/etc/env.php

chown -R smile.<php_fpm_group> <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/pub
chmod -R 664 <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/pub
chmod -R +X <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/pub
```

## Share Between Fronts

The following folders and files must be shared between the fronts.

They must be moved from the shared directory to the NAS, and symlinks must be created to the shared folder:

- app/etc/config.php
- app/etc/env.php
- pub/media
- pub/static/_cache
- var/importexport
- var/import_history

# Use the Shared Folders and Files

<warning> All the following actions must be made on `frontMain` and `frontOthers`.

## Clean

Remove the shared folders and files in the release:

```
rm -rf <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>/var/log
rm -rf <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>/var/report
rm -rf <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>/var/importexport
rm -rf <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>/var/import_history

rm -rf <main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>/app/etc/env.php
```

## Create the Symlinks

```
ln -s \
<main_www_folder>/<project_name>/shared/var/log \
<main_www_folder>/<project_name>/releases/<project_name>_<release_version>/var/log

ln -s \
