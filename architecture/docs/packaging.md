# Prepare your package for delivery

You can build a delivery archive using spbuilder.
Spbuilder will:

- Get the sources from your vcs repository
- Launch the composer install
- Remove the useless files and folders
- Create the archive
 
Launch the following command from the *magento folder*:

```
$ vendor/bin/spbuilder package
```

By default, it uses your current branch.

You can specify a specific branch with the `--force-branch` option.

You can specify a specific tag with the `--force-tag` option.
 
**See https://git.smile.fr/dirtech/spbuilder for more information.**

Then, you can use the deploy script to deliver this package on a specific environment.
 
The deploy script also integrate a optional package building step of the requested version
before trying to deliver, if you want to do packaging and deploying in a single step.
